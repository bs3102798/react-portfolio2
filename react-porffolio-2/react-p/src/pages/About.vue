            <p>Burness Scott III is a dedicated and resilient person who puts his all in anything that he does. In his
                determination he learned about Programing and learned what he needed to do to further his career in the
                field. In doing so he learned about UCR codeing bootcamp and commited his self to learnign as much as he
                could. He did strugle on some project staying up late to finish them, he finished them none the less. With
                the jouney of the Bootcamp coming to a close the real steps towards his story in coding will soon begin.
